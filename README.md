# Emojifier 
#### Turn words into emojis in real time! Leveraging LSTM-based NLP and GloVe embeddings, this project maps text to contextually relevant emojis, enhancing digital communication for chatbots, messaging apps, and social media platforms. Demonstrates end-to-end NLP workflow from text preprocessing to emoji prediction with an interactive demo.
## Features
